 I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man. I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting. I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham.

 Swear to me! I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner. It's ends here. The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.

 This isn't a car. I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham. It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me. I'm Batman It's ends here. Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.
